# Automated Portfolio for S&P500 based on Deep Learning Price Predictions

This project was done for a third year curricular unit (Laboratórios de Inteligência Artificial e Ciência de Dados).

Using the Yfinance library, and collecting data of the S&P500 (open, closes, splits, ...) from 2010 to 2024, I developed two models (Random Forest and MLP) that predict the closing price of the next day for all S&P500 companies.<br>
These predictions are then used to simulate monthly stock investments using Monte Carlo.

Really promising!
